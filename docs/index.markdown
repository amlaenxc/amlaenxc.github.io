I have recently started as the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computational Sciences Librarian at Stanford's Robin Li and Melissa Ma Science Library, located in the Sapp Center for Science Teaching and Learning, aka ``Old Chem''. I will add more information about my role here once I have settled in a bit more!

I graduated with a PhD in Mathematics from Rice University in May 2024. My advisor was Prof. Shelly Harvey, and my mathematical interests are in satellite constructions, knot concordance, and 4-dimensional manifolds, especially in the topological setting. I received a B.S. in Mathematics with Departmental Honors from the University of Chicago in 2019.

Preprints (both submitted for publication):

- [``New examples of topologically slice links''](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11594){:target="_blank"}
- [``Action of the Mazur patter up to topological concordance''](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13640){:target="_blank"}

I have also worked as the Mathematics Collection Development assistant at Rice's Fondren Library. I assisted with the selection and acquisition of new books, as well as the weeding of of damaged and outdated books in the collection. Additionally, I contributed to our online research guides, particularly the guides on math and AI, and focusing on the history of math and the relationship between AI and accessibility. I also helped to run events introducing students to the university's Overleaf subscription.

As a graduate student, I co-organized the following conferences:

- Nearly Carbon Neutral Geometry and Topology Conference (2023, co-organizer of the concordance section, virtual)
- Log cabin conference on concordance and knotted surfaces, Sedona (2023)

I also gave invited talks in the following venues:

- Low-Dimensional Topology conference at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune (2023)
- Low-Dimensional Topology Seminar at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Bonn (2023)
- Centre Interuniversitaire de Recherches en Ge&#769;ome&#769;trie et Topologie Junior, Universite&#769; du Que&#769;bec a&#768; Montre&#769;al (2023, virtual)
- Joint Mathematics Meeting, Boston (2023)
- Geometric Topology Grad and Postdoc Seminar (2022, virtual)
- AMS Fall Western Sectional, Salt Lake City (2022)
