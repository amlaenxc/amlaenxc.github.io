I have recently started as the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computational Sciences Librarian at Stanford's Robin Li and Melissa Ma Science Library. I will add more information about my role here once I have settled in a bit more!

I recently (May 2024) graduated with a PhD in Mathematics from Rice University. My advisor was Prof. Shelly Harvey, and my mathematical interests are in satellite constructions, knot concordance, and 4-dimensional manifolds, especially in the topological setting.

I received a B.S. in Mathematics with Departmental Honors from the University of Chicago in 2019.

Preprints (both have been submitted for publication):

    "New examples of topologically slice links" https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11594

    "Action of the Mazur pattern up to topological concordance" https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13640

I have also worked as the Mathematics Collection Development assistant at Rice's Fondren Library. I assisted with the selection and acquisition of new books, as well as the weeding of of damaged and outdated books in the collection. Additionally, I contributed to our online research guides (https://libguides.rice.edu/), particularly the guides on math and AI, and focusing on the history of math and the relationship between AI and accessibility. I also helped to run events introducing students to the university's Overleaf subscription.

I have also been involved in the Hatch Youth program at the Montrose Center in Houston, an after-school program providing tutoring and social activities aimed at LGBTQ youth in the Houston area.
