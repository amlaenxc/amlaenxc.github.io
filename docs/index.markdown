I have recently started as the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computational Sciences Librarian at Stanford's Robin Li and Melissa Ma Science Library. I will add more information about my role here once I have settled in a bit more!

I recently (May 2024) graduated with a PhD in Mathematics from Rice University. My advisor was Prof. Shelly Harvey, and my mathematical interests are in satellite constructions, knot concordance, and 4-dimensional manifolds, especially in the topological setting.

I received a B.S. in Mathematics with Departmental Honors from the University of Chicago in 2019.

I have also worked as the Mathematics Collection Development assistant at Rice's Fondren Library. I assisted with the selection and acquisition of new books, as well as the weeding of of damaged and outdated books in the collection. Additionally, I contributed to our online research guides, particularly the guides on math and AI, and focusing on the history of math and the relationship between AI and accessibility. I also helped to run events introducing students to the university's Overleaf subscription.
