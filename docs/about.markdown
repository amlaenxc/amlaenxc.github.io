I am a fourth-year graduate student in the math department at Rice University. I am interested in concordance and 4-dimensional manifolds, and am working with Prof. Shelly Harvey.

I received a B.S. in mathematics with departmental honors from the University of Chicago in 2019.

I have also been involved in the Hatch Youth program at the Montrose Center, an after-school program providing tutoring and social activities aimed at LGBTQ youth.
